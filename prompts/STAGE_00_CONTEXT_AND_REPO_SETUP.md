# Stage 00 — Context and Repo Setup for KiteWorkforce

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Create the initial monorepo for **KiteWorkforce**: Marketplace where AI agents bid for tasks, execute work, and get paid on Kite.

This stage should establish a clean foundation only. Do not build all product modules yet.

## Product constraints
- Product name: `KiteWorkforce`
- Repo name: `kiteworkforce`
- Header subtitle: `WORKFORCE`
- Positioning: A productive agent labor marketplace: humans or companies post tasks, agents bid, work is verified, escrow is released, and reputation improves.

## Required monorepo structure

Create this structure:

```txt
packages/web/          Vite + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 frontend
packages/api/          Hono API server
packages/worker/       background jobs and queues
packages/core/         pure TypeScript domain logic
packages/connectors/   KiteScan, RPC, webhook, LLM, wallet/API connectors
```

Only add `packages/contracts/` if a later stage explicitly needs contracts.

## Frontend requirements
- Vite React TypeScript project under `packages/web`.
- Tailwind v4 using inline `@theme` in CSS.
- Copy the design values from `THEME.md` exactly.
- Add Geist and Geist Mono Google font links in `index.html`.
- Add shared components:
  - `SiteHeader`
  - `SiteFooter`
  - `KiteLogo`
  - `AddressDisplay`
  - `PreviewBadge`
  - `StatusBadge`
  - `MonoValue`
  - `EmptyState`
  - `ErrorState`
- Build a basic landing page with hero, product promise, module cards, and PREVIEW honesty banner.

## Backend requirements
- Hono API in `packages/api`.
- Health route: `GET /health` returns `{ ok: true, service: "kiteworkforce" }`.
- Shared environment loader with `.env.example`.
- Add CORS configured for local web dev.

## Core package requirements
- Add `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- Add common types: `KiteAddress`, `TxHash`, `ISODate`, `RiskLevel`, `PreviewStatus`.
- Add validators for EVM address and tx hash.

## Connector package requirements
- Add Kite chain constants.
- Add KiteScan API base helper.
- Add cached fetch helper with TTL.
- Add placeholder RPC client helper using viem.

## Deliverables
- Full monorepo initialized.
- Root `package.json` with pnpm workspaces.
- Root `README.md` with what the product does.
- `.env.example` for all packages.
- Basic dev scripts:
  - `pnpm dev`
  - `pnpm -r typecheck`
  - `pnpm -r test`
  - `pnpm -r lint`

## Acceptance criteria
- Web app renders the landing page.
- API health route works.
- TypeScript builds.
- No forbidden fonts/colors.
- README clearly says what is real and what is PREVIEW.

## Required verification

Run these commands and fix all issues before ending the stage:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint || true
pnpm -r test || true
grep -rn "Instrument\|font-instrument\|font-serif" packages/web/src packages/web/index.html || true
grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.
