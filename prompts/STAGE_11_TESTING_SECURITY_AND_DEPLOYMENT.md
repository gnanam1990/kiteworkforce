# Stage 11 — Testing, Security, and Deployment for KiteWorkforce

You are OpenCode working inside this repo. Follow the prompt exactly. Do not skip requirements. Do not invent missing official contract addresses, token addresses, or unsupported claims. If a feature depends on unconfirmed mainnet contracts, implement it as PREVIEW/testnet/mock-safe only with clear UI labels.

Before writing code in this stage:
1. Read `THEME.md` in the repo root.
2. Read `KITE_CONTEXT.md` or `00_SHARED_KITE_CONTEXT.md` if present.
3. Inspect the existing codebase and summarize current structure in one paragraph.
4. Only then implement this stage.


## Goal
Harden **KiteWorkforce** so it is not just a demo. Add tests, security checks, deployment docs, environment examples, and operational safety.

## Test requirements
Add tests for:
- Core domain logic.
- Zod validation.
- API route happy paths.
- API route failure paths.
- Worker job success/failure/retry.
- Payment verification logic if present.
- Policy/approval logic if present.
- UI smoke tests for critical pages if test stack exists.

## Security requirements
- No secrets in frontend code.
- No raw private keys in repository.
- `.env.example` contains names only, no real secrets.
- All external URLs are validated.
- HMAC verification for webhooks where relevant.
- Rate-limit write endpoints.
- Add request IDs and structured logs.
- Add clear PREVIEW/UNAUDITED warnings for risky modules.

## Production readiness checklist
Create `PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md` covering:
- Required environment variables.
- Database migration steps.
- Worker deployment steps.
- API deployment steps.
- Web deployment steps.
- RPC/API rate-limit considerations.
- Payment token address confirmation.
- Mainnet risk warnings.
- Backup/recovery expectations.

## Deployment docs
Create docs for:

```txt
docs/LOCAL_DEV.md
docs/DEPLOYMENT.md
docs/SECURITY.md
docs/API.md
```

## UI QA checklist
- Cream background.
- Sand primary buttons.
- Olive success states.
- Rust destructive/warning states.
- No violet/cyan/indigo/neon.
- No glassmorphism/glow/gradient text.
- All numbers/addresses/hashes in mono.
- PREVIEW badges on incomplete/heuristic/mock/unaudited parts.

## Acceptance criteria
- `pnpm -r typecheck` passes.
- Tests pass or documented skipped tests are justified.
- Security docs exist.
- Deployment docs exist.
- No forbidden visual patterns.
- Product can be demoed end-to-end locally with seeded data.

## Required verification

Run these commands and fix all issues before ending the stage:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r lint || true
pnpm -r test || true
grep -rn "Instrument\|font-instrument\|font-serif" packages/web/src packages/web/index.html || true
grep -rn "violet\|indigo\|cyan\|#7C3AED\|#4F46E5\|#06B6D4" packages/web/src || true
```

Expected:
- TypeScript passes.
- No forbidden fonts.
- No forbidden colors in non-comment UI code.
- UI uses Kite palette only: sand, cream, olive, deep brown, warm rust.
- All addresses, hashes, balances, block numbers, tx IDs use `font-mono`.
